**Hi there** 👋

<!--<img src="images/danielfv-profile.png" width="200px" />-->

I'm <strong>Daniel</strong> and I'm a Cloud Engineer working with Microsoft Azure.

I love learning new things every day. I usually document what I'm currently learning and my everyday journey on the cloud on my [Blog](https://blog.danielfv.com), so feel free to follow me over there to find out what I've been up to. 😉 

I love working on projects together, so do not hesitate to reach out for collaboration!

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on all things Azure 
- 📘 Posting on my blog about Cloud Computing
- 🔥 I’m currently learning DevOps, Go and automation using Python, PowerShell and Terraform

From time to time I work with:
