## About me

<div style="text-align: left">
<img style="float:right" src="../images/danielfv-profile.png" width="200" />

Hi! I'm <strong>Daniel</strong>. 

I'm a Systems Engineer turned Cloud Engineer obsessed with all things cloud. 
</div>


I specialize in Microsoft Azure being certified as Azure Solutions Architect  and Azure Administrator.

I love creating stuff in computers. While I'm not a professinal developer, I first fell in love with programming ever since I started learning BASIC in 1990 when I was growing up. I loved the way it allowed me to release my creativity while trying to solve problems using technology.

I graduated from college as a System Engineer but ever since then I have been working in the telecommunications industry for the last 15 years. Being part of a telecom company made me learn about networking, wireless networks, to manage Linux servers and now the cloud.



I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!


## What I like to do


When I'm not working in Azure I like to read. From the latest Stephen King novel to classical (and newer) sci-fi books, to new business management books.

Hobbies:
- Playing guitar
- Listening to podcasts
- Photography ([flickr.com/dfv78](http://flickr.com/dfv78))
- Did I mention [I love reading]([https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4642546?shelf=currently-reading)?
## What I'm currently doing
I've always enjoyed learning new things so I'm constantly trying to learn about a technology that's new to me:

- Azure SQL databases (I'm in the process of studying for the certification)
- DevOps
- Python
- C#
