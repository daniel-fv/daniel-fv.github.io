## About me
Hi! I'm **Daniel**. I'm a Cloud Engineer obsessed with all things Azure.

I graduated from college as a Systems Engineer but now I have more than 15 years working in the telecommunications industry and as a Linux Systems Administrator.

Being part of a telecom company for more than 15 years made me learn about networking, wireless networks and to manage Linux servers.

Right now I specialize in Microsoft Azure being certified as Azure Solutions Architect Expert and Azure Administrator Associate. 

I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!

### What I'm currently doing
