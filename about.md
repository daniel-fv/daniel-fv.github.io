Hi! I'm Daniel and I'm an Azure Cloud Solutions Architect.

I've had more than 15 years working in the telecommunications industry and as a Linux Systems Administrator working with open source technologies.

With experience in networking, wireless networks, and cloud solutions, my goal is to discover new technologies that will allow companies to improve their overall productivity and operational efficiency.
